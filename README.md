# MyComp
This is a project for building a new programming language for my compiler laboratory course. The project is built with C++, Bison and FLEX. The language has basic components like variables and literals. It has if blocks, switch blocks and loops. This basic language can do arithmatic and comparison operations, take input from user, print stuff etc.
